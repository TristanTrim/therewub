# therewub
Dubstep theremin. Here a wub, there a wub, everywhere a wub wub.

This is kinda a prototype of a theremin I think it would be cool to build. It would have 4 antennas instead of just 2, so you could use your left hand to control both the volume and pitch of the melodic tone, and then use your other hand to control the a sub-audible frequency that modulates the melodic frequency, and the amount by which it modulates. This modulating frequency I believe is more commonly known as "the wub".

If that didn't make much sense to you it's probably better to just play with it to see what I mean:

Now availiable with autotuning!

[C major / A minor](https://tristantrim.github.io/therewub/?car=CmajAmin)

[Chromatic](https://tristantrim.github.io/therewub/?car=Chrom)

It right now needs a multi-touch device like a phone to run on. It also only works on Firefox afaik. Should be easy enough to get it to work on chrome as well, but I'd have to find time to do it. Drop me a line if it breaks for you, or if you have any thoughts.

I think it would be better to build an actual theremin like this cause there's something about actual EM fields that capacitive digital displays don't have... But this does have the advantage of being sharable on the web, which is pretty cool imo.
